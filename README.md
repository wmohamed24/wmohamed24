<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Aser Atawya</h1>
<h3 align="center">A computer science junior at Pomona College in Claremont, California</h3>

- I’m currently working as a product manager for Avela EdTech start-up in San Francisco. 
- Previously, I designed a convolutional neural network to simulate human driving in a virtual environment with the help of Udacity open-source self-driving car simulator. Check out the [project repo!](https://github.com/Aser-Abdelfatah/Neural-Networks-for-Self-Driving-Cars)
- Also, I did Google Summer of Code 2023 for OpenCV, where I added Recurrent All-pairs Field Transforms (RAFT model) to OpenCV model zoo, optimized visualization module, and provided scripts for evaluation and examples in C++ and Python
